          Gold solved portability and trust by being scarce and costly to changeâ€”ideal as a base
          settlement layer. Banks issued redeemable notes, then central banks standardized notes.
          International imbalances moved gold between nations, disciplining excess issuance.

          Wars broke convertibility. Bretton Woods pegged currencies to USD, USD to gold. In 1971,
          convertibility ended and the world moved to free-floating fiat. Demand for currency is
          maintained via legal tender status and taxes, with monetary policy used to manage the
          economy and inflation risks.
