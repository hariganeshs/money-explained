        <p className="p">
          Two trajectories: centralized Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and decentralized
          cryptocurrencies. CBDC makes fiat programmable and gives central banks direct tools to
          manage supply and rails. Crypto uses distributed ledgers with rules enforced by consensus,
          aiming for openness and credible neutrality.
